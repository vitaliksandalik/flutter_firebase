I've used Firebase, Riverpod, and CRUD operations in this project. The app supports user registration, login, password recovery, and the storage of user data.

Enjoy this awesome UI!

## Sneak Peek

Here's a quick look at what the app offers:

- **User Registration**: Sign up with your email, username, age, name, surname, and password.
- **Login Functionality**: Securely log in to access personalized features. All data is encrypted!
- **Account Recovery**: Reset your password with email verification.

**More to come! As you can see, I have already created 2 pages; one of them is, in this case, my portfolio. This app can easily evolve into a social media platform to share your portfolios.**
